# event-management
This Event Management System is a comprehensive C++ application designed to streamline
the planning and coordination of events. This object-oriented program integrates multiple
components including event creation, scheduling, task management, budget tracking, vendor
coordination, and feedback collection. By centralizing these functions in one cohesive
system, the application eliminates the inefficiencies of fragmented planning methods. The
system implements key OOP concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, and
polymorphism to create a modular yet integrated solution. Testing demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in managing event workflows while providing real-time budget oversight and
schedule validation. This project addresses the growing need for digital solutions in the
events industry, where organization and coordination are paramount to success.
